# Skybox Gallery and Generator Tool

Skybox Gallery is a web-based tool for generating and exploring 3D images called Skyboxes. A Skybox is a 6-sided cube that represents the environment around the viewer. Skybox Gallery offers a variety of generator options, each with its unique algorithm, to create Skyboxes using prompts, seed values, and other customizable parameters. The tool uses the [Blockade Labs API](https://www.blockadelabs.com/) to generate and retrieve gallery images.
