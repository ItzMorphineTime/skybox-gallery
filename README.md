# Skybox Gallery and Generator Tool

Skybox Gallery and Generator Tool is a web-based tool that generates and displays 360-degree projections of 2D textures onto a sphere or equorectangular mesh, known as Skyboxes. The tool uses Bootstrap and Handlebars to create a gallery of generated Skybox images and a modal popup to display each image in a 3D virtual environment using Three.js. The Skyboxes are generated using various algorithms and customizable parameters, and the tool uses the [Blockade Labs API](https://www.blockadelabs.com/) to generate and retrieve the images.
